Week 2 log:

For week 2, I worked on generating a Python script that is capable of connecting to the Intel RealSense D435i camera in order to capture images every 1 second. This script along with the camera will be used for capturing data that contains information about the environment in an image form. The Python codes provided by the official GitHub repository by Intel was a source utilized to help with generating the Python script used in this project (source URL: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git). In my code, each captured image is saved under a timestamp. Additionally, the data collected from the other sensors (vehicle telemetry, inertia measurement unit (IMU) data, odometry data, and GPS data) are saved under timestamps as well to allow for correlation among each data type. This code is found under EnergyConsumptionPredictionFiles/codes/capture_image_data.py on this GitHub. 

Additionally, I performed data collection to obtain a training dataset for the neural network. This dataset of collected data contains image data that captures the environment the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is navigating through, along with GPS data, telemetry, IMU, and odometry data associated with the UGV when navigating. The UGV was ran on a grassy surface/field for about 1 hour in which 3612 images capturing various portions of the grassy field were collected, along with the data obtained from the other sensors on the UGV. The collected data can now be put together and utilized for training a neural network.
