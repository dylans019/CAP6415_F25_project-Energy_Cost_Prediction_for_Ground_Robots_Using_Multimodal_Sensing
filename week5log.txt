Week 5 log:

This week, I added Google Drive links in the README.md file on GitHub in order for the collected training and test camera image datasets to be downloaded. The image datasets needed to be uploaded to a Google Drive rather than to this GitHub repository due to GitHub file size limitations. Additionally, the test datasets of the numerical data that was collected from each sensor on the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) was uploaded to this GitHub repository. The test data can be found in “EnergyConsumptionPredictionFiles/data/test_dataset”. 

Additionally, I generated a script capable of testing our trained model on the test data. The script outputs various metrics and a plot that represents the performance of the trained model on predicting the energy consumption of the UGV, based on the information provided by the camera and other sensors located on the UGV when it is traversing through a specific type of terrain. Using the outputted metrics and plot generated by this script, I was able to analyze and understand the overall performance of the trained model. I was also able to understand what factors caused the model to perform poorly in certain aspects. Through this analysis, I could find ways to improve the performance of the model. This script also outputs a CSV file that contains the model’s predicted energy cost values for each timestamp which can be compared to the true energy cost values per timestamp shown in the same CSV file. 

I also obtained images of the camera setup on the UGV, a demonstration video of the UGV running on grassy terrain collecting data, and the obtained results from the trained model. These results are saved in “Results” on Github.
