Week 1 Log:

This week, I was able to do some research on the Intel RealSense D435i camera I will be using for my research project. Some sources I utilized to familiarize myself with the camera included https://realsenseai.com/stereo-depth-cameras/depth-camera-d435i/. This source provides details about the camera's specs such as its minimum depth distance, depth accuracy, depth frame rate, RGB frame rate and RGB frame resolution. Learning about the camera's specs allows for me to understand its various capabilities and its limitations which can be considered when used within my project. 

Additionally, I found and explored the official GitHub repository provided by Intel shown on this web link: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master. When looking at their files under wrappers/python/examples, I found various example codes written in Python to help me get started with the camera and test out its various functions. Some particular code examples that seem most applicable to my project include “python-tutorial-1-depth.py” and “opencv_pointcloud_viewer.py”. With these example codes, I am able to understand how to turn the camera on, access and view the camera’s color images and its depth images, as well as save images to my computer. These codes will be used as a source to help me generate my own codes that can access the color image data from the Intel camera and save multiple images for the process of data collection for my project.
