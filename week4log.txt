Week 4 log:

This week, I worked on generating and finalizing a script used for training a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model (ResNet18) on the image data of the terrain obtained by the camera. The CNN model also extracts features numerically of each image. Additionally, a multilayer perception model is utilized and trained on the numerical image features as well as the numerical data obtained from the other UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) sensors. Additionally, since the collected data is obtained in separate CSV files, the script combines all of the CSV data together. By combining the CSV files into one dataset, the image data, telemetry data, odometry data, IMU data, and GPS data, will be aligned at the same timestamp. This ensures that each image is correctly corresponded to the numerical sensor data, allowing for the model to correctly learn the relationship between the collected data. This code is saved in the Github repository in “EnergyConsumptionPredictionFiles/codes/NN-code.py”.

Preliminary Results: I ran the code to train the CNN and MLP models on the dataset containing data from the camera and each sensor on the UGV. Since a portion of the dataset was split into a testing set, the performance of the trained model can be analyzed. The model produced a mean absolute relative error of 15.87% when it was tested on the spit test set. This means that the trained model performs well when predicting the UGV’s energy consumption per meter in which there is an average error of 15.87% in its prediction.
